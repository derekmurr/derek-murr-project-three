# Type Scale Generator

A handy, simple tool to let developers make sites that are typographically harmonious without needing design training. 

Just pick a typographic scale from the dropdown menu, then a typeface (which will be dynamically loaded from Google Fonts), and TSG will do the math, giving you font sizes for headings 1 through 6, body copy and small text that will all look nice together. You can then copy the CSS to the clipboard and drop it in your own stylesheet.

Made as a first JQuery project as part of cohort 22 at HackerYou in Toronto, Canada.
